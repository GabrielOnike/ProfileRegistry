# ProfileRegistry
A simple CRUD Profile Registry Application I built with PHP. 

visit www.ngonike.dev/apps/profile-registry for the live version of this codebase.

If you are adapting this code, note that "pdo.php" is absent here as it connects to the database and since this file has live code, 
it is apt to keep it out for security reasons. Also, you would have to use your own salt in 'login.php' for the passwords. You can rebuild the database
with SQL.
